                    <h4>PERSONALIZED TO STUDENTS</h4>
                    <p>YOU focuses on three main areas of college life—SUCCEED, THRIVE and MATTER. Within each of the domains, students connect to content to improve their health, sense of purpose as well as their academic and professional aspirations.</p>
                    <p>Personalization is key—in college and on YOU. Students can explore customized content by filling out their demographic information on their user profile and by taking each of the three Reality Checks, which provide them with a quick report on how they can better SUCCEED, THRIVE and MATTER.</p>
                     <p>YOU is completely anonymous. In order to foster the most honest and effective experience on the portal, student information, activity and results are kept confidential.</p>

                        <p>Everyone has their favorite spot on campus. The Dashboard is that spot on YOU. It summarizes student interaction with the site, including favorites, goal setting/tracking and even a countdown to graduation.</p>

                    <p>Customized not only to the student, but also to the identity of their college, YOU gives campuses an added dimension. When bringing YOU to your campus, the portal is re-designed to match the brand and graphic standard of each, individual institution.</p>
                        <p>The portal is also built to incorporate resources unique to each campus for the times when students are in need of resources close to home. By compiling college-specific content into a tool for mobile and desktop use, YOU truly functions as a resource embedded in the campus community.</p>

                        <p>YOU is a portal that was built in tandem with Colorado State University with the intent to be used by campus communities everywhere. Disjointed and hard to access services on a college campus cause obstacles for both students and staff. YOU is the student-centric solution that brings it all together.</p>
                        <p>See for yourself how introducing YOU to campus can help student engagement and success.</p>
