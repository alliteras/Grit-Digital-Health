                    <p>The first tool of its kind on college campuses, YOU fosters self-awareness and individual well-being to connect students to evidence-based/supported information, campus resources, peers and opportunities. YOU is an innovative digital tool that serves as a comprehensive resource hub for the student experience - available 24/7 and accessible whenever and wherever they need it.</p>
                    <p>Each student’s experience with YOU is anonymous, personalized and unique. Input from the student’s personal profile and results from the Reality Check self-assessments allow YOU to optimize hundreds of resources that match student’s most pressing challenges. With ever-changing content and tools, YOU adapts alongside students from move-in day through graduation.</p>
                    <p>YOU not only introduces students to the importance of building personal resilience and mental well-being, but it also equips them with the tools, information and campus connections needed for a successful college experience. </p>

                        <h4>Form-tackling male mental health to prevent suicide.</h4>
                        <p>Since its 2012 launch, Man Therapy’s multimedia suicide-prevention campaign has proven that using humor gets serious results. Our target? Working-aged men in “Double Jeopardy”, a population that accounts for the largest number of suicide deaths, and is also the least likely to seek or receive any kind of support.</p>
                        <p>Through interactive content, our doctor-in-residence Dr. Rich Mahogany uses a one-two punch of manly humor and disarming bluntness on topics that are normally taboo, giving men permission to acknowledge their feelings and take their next step - whatever that may be. Dr. Rich Mahogany invites guys to take the eye-opening 20-Point Head Inspection, examine their own wellness and consider a wide array of actions, tools and resources designed to put them on the path to treatment and recovery. </p>
                        <p>The idea? Reduce stigma and get men to view mental health as they would a broken leg or open wound. We achieve this by speaking to guys in a way that no other mental health initiative has before. </p>
