            <p>For the past ten years, Chris has been navigating the dynamic world of customer engagement with the understanding that every connection - whether between two people or people interacting with technology - is an experience that matters. He has provided digital media strategy consultation for some of the world's largest corporations' public relations, investor relations and marketing departments, as well as small businesses and local Colorado nonprofits. Grit's solutions are designed to spark meaningful change with each and every individual from students to administrators. Because Chris believes that every interaction matters, combining his background and approach with Grit's experienced team and powerful technology makes for a winning combination.</p>
            <p><strong>Chris's grit developed early in life, </strong>instilled by the example of his generous and hard working parents, Dave and Sue. But it grew into an unstoppable force through his countless interactions with people, and more specifically customers, learning from invested mentors and ultimately watching his two brothers David and Phil get gritty by taking big risks to go after their own valuable life goals and callings. When you're surrounded by grit, it has a way of making its way into your own life. Chris' wife Ashley, son Barrett and dog Luna keep his grit and drive alive and well.</p>
